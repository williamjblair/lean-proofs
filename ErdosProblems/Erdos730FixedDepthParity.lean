# Erdős 730: a character-free fixed-depth digit-parity estimate

This file isolates a finite combinatorial shadow of the fixed-depth Fourier
step in the positive-density proof.  Suppose an independent base-`p` digit
has `marked` possible values which toggle a parity bit and `unmarked` possible
values which preserve it.  `digitParityCounts marked unmarked d` is the exact
two-state recurrence for the number of length-`d` strings ending in even and
odd parity.

For the half-digit alphabet used in the Erdős 730 argument, `p = 2*H-1`,
`marked = H`, and `unmarked = H-1`.  The two parity classes then differ by
exactly one string at every depth.  In particular the doubled even count has
absolute error exactly `1` from the uniform main term `p^d`; after
normalization the error is exactly `1/(2*p^d)`.

This is deliberately character-free: it is the order-two finite Fourier
calculation written as an exact integer recurrence.  It does not assert the
quadratic incomplete-sum estimate of Lemma 2 in the paper proof.
