# Erdős 730: analytic higher-power envelope

This module specializes the generic Tannery theorem to the exact normalized
term in equation (26).  It also proves that the number of terminal `+1`
payments remains sublinear after replacing the branch cutoff `X` by the
uniform bound `380827 X`.

The only remaining finite-combinatorial input for the actual event ledger is
the pointwise inequality saying that each branch event count is bounded by
this envelope plus one terminal payment.
