# Minimal distinct covering systems

This file pins down the objects counted in Erdős Problem 1188.  A congruence
class is stored canonically as `(modulus, residue)` with `2 ≤ modulus` and
`residue < modulus`.  Thus two pairs represent the same class exactly when they
are equal.

The phrase "estimate `F(x)`" in the source problem does not prescribe one
particular asymptotic assertion.  `coveringCount` is the faithful formal object;
all proposed upper or lower estimates must be theorems about this function.
