# Nonvacuity of the Erdős--Graham extremal function

An eventual family of finite cyclic removal bounds gives a finite bound for
every order: pad any smaller parent representation with zero up to an order
where the eventual theorem applies.  Hence every nonempty set of attainable
exact orders has a greatest element.
