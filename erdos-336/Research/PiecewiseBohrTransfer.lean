# A finite compact cover turns a piecewise patch into a thick sumset

This file isolates the elementary combinatorial part of a proposed
piecewise-Bohr transference argument for Erdős Problem 336.  No topology is
needed in the lemma: all topological input has already been compressed into a
finite family of shifts covering every image point.

/-- If `P` contains the part of a thick set `T` lying over a patch `U`, and
finitely many shifts make the inverse image of `U` cover every integer, then
`P` plus those shifts is thick.  The map `φ` need not be a homomorphism for
this purely combinatorial step. -/

is in `kD`, then `(q+k)D` is thick. -/
