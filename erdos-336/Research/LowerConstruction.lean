# The two-residue lower construction when the weak order is divisible by three

For `h=3u`, Plagne's extremal cyclic construction uses modulus
`g=3u²+4u+1` and residues `{1, x}`, where `x=3u+3`.  This file verifies the
entire finite covering calculation: every residue modulo `g` is a positive
sum of at most `3u` copies of `1` and `x`.
