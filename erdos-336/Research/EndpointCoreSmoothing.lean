# Smoothing a represented core interval with cheap endpoint summands

The key finite-cyclic fibre-filling observation: a core interval already
representable with `t` original summands can be widened at unit cost per step
using two endpoint elements of the original set.

/-- Suppose every point of `[a,a+M]` is representable by exactly `t` members
of `A`, and `p,p+L∈A`.  After taking `r` core blocks and `k` endpoint terms,
every point of the full interval of width `rM+kL` is representable using
exactly `rt+k` original summands.  In particular, endpoint widening costs one
summand per step, not `t` summands per step. -/
