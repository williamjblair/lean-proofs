# Arithmetic optimization in the Deléglise interval-cover argument

For `h = r+s+q`, the overlap count produces

`D = (r+1)(s+q) + s*q`.

The two-distance parameters `s,q` are positive and coprime.  This file proves
that `D` is at most the reciprocal of Deléglise's optimal interval length.

/-- The elementary three-residue-class optimization behind `L(h)`.

For `h ≡ 2 (mod 3)` the exceptional real maximizer would have `s=q`; the
coprimality hypothesis excludes it (apart from `h=2`, which is outside the
stated range), yielding the correction by two in the numerator. -/
