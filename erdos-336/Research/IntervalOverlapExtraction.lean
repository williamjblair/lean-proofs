# Algebraic extraction from the interval-overlap count

Plagne's equations (3.10)--(3.11) produce the doubled overlap inequality used
below.  This file verifies, independently of the geometric derivation, that
this inequality has precisely the Deléglise coefficient and hence leading
constant `1/3`.
