## Verdict

The attachment is a mathematical report, not an importable theorem package.
It contains no Lean source and the four linked verifier/certificate artifacts
were not attached. Therefore no certificate-dependent theorem was imported
directly from the attachment. The normalization repair and exact
reduced-binomial bounds have since been independently reconstructed in Lean.

Several symbolic arguments in the report are mathematically viable after the
repairs below. They remain reconstruction targets until expressed and checked
in Lean.

## Accepted claims

The following claims are accepted as correct mathematical interfaces. The
first reduced-binomial item has since been reconstructed and kernel-checked in
`Erdos686NormalizedMatching.lean`; the remaining items are still designs to
formalize, subject to their stated hypotheses:

1. The reduced-binomial ratio bound
   `a_ij,b_ij <= binom(k-1,|i-j|)`. The unreduced ratio is
   `binom(k-j,r)/binom(j+r-1,r)` for `i=j+r`; reduction can only decrease
   numerator and denominator. **Kernel-banked after this audit.**
2. For a matching with distinct signed offsets,
   `sum max(a_ij,b_ij) <= 2^k-1`.
3. The square-Hermite dimension count: the degree bounds
   `deg U <= m`, `deg V <= m-1` give `2m+1` coefficients and the value and
   derivative conditions give `2m` homogeneous equations.
4. The coefficient-height envelope
   `(12*m*D_k*k^m)^(2m)`. Matrix entries are at most `6*D_k*k^m`;
   a maximal-rank cofactor has size at most
   `(2m * 6*D_k*k^m)^(2m)`.
5. The Taylor step modulo `P^2`, provided `P | n+j` and
   `P | d+i-j`.
6. In the zero branch, the treatment of support nodes with `V(j)=0`:
   then `U(j)=0`, so both terms of `Phi_S` vanish to order at least two
   when `k>=2`.
7. The rational-map nonvanishing strategy. If `Phi_S=0`, then for
   `psi=T+U/V`, the identity `W o psi=4W` is an equality of rational maps.
   Composition degree gives `k*deg(psi)=k`; absence of finite poles makes
   `psi` affine; comparison of leading coefficients would require a rational
   `k`-th root of `4`, impossible for `k>=3`.
8. Once `W_S^2 | Phi_S` is proved in `Z[T]`, the monicity of `W_S^2`
   gives an integral quotient. The implication `Q_S(-n)=0` uses
   `W_S(-n) != 0` and does not divide by `V(-n)`.
9. The ordinary Lagrange matching resultant, including the singleton
   specialization, is a valid target when rows are distinct.

These are accepted as proof designs, not as repository theorems.

## Repaired claims

### A. Normalization

Let

```text
L = (k-1)!
C_h = binom(k-1,h-1)
F_h = L/C_h
g = gcd(C_i,C_j)
a = C_i/g
b = C_j/g
s = (-1)^(i+j)
x = n+j
y = n+d+i
```

Then the exact integer identity is

```text
F_i*(d+i-j) - (4*s*F_j-F_i)*x
  = (L/lcm(C_i,C_j)) *
      (b*(d+i-j) - (4*s*a-b)*x).
```

Equivalence of the two `P^2` divisibilities is not unconditional. It requires

```text
Coprime P ((k-1)!)
```

or an equivalent hypothesis saying every prime divisor of `P` exceeds `k`.
That hypothesis makes the prefactor a unit modulo the composite modulus
`P^2`. The attachment uses high-prime owner moduli, so the repair is
compatible with its intended application, but it must appear explicitly in
the Lean theorem interface.

### D. Nonvanishing of `Phi_S`

The equation

```text
deg(W o psi) = k * deg(psi)
```

must be stated for rational maps. It must not be justified by uncancelled
numerator degrees. The proof also needs separate facts that `psi` is
nonconstant and that a finite pole of `psi` produces a finite pole of
`W o psi`.

### E. Square divisibility

The Taylor expansion has the exact remainder form

```text
U(-n)+d*V(-n)
  = delta*V(j)
    - x*(U'(j)-rho*V'(j))
    - delta*x*V'(j)        mod P^2.
```

The sign of the last term is immaterial for divisibility, but the Lean proof
should use the exact identity. Cancellation of `beta_ij` again requires the
explicit high-prime coprimality hypothesis.

### F. Height

The stated height is consistent only after using `m<=k` to absorb derivative
factors into `k^m`. This hypothesis must be present in the height theorem.

## Rejected or unverified claims

1. The claim that the package was computationally certified is unverified:
   none of the four linked files exists in the attachment or repository.
2. The advertised 89,426 normalization and reduced-ratio checks are
   unverified for the same reason.
3. The advertised row-binomial-lcm scan through `k=64`, Hermite checks,
   `W_S^2` checks, synthetic `P^2` checks, and ordinary resultant checks are
   unverified.
4. The symbolic identity
   `lcm_h binom(k-1,h-1)=lcm(1,...,k)/k` is plausible and passed an
   independent exact finite scan through `k=400`, but no proof is imported.
5. The global inequality `B_{>k}(k,n)>3(n+1)` is not proved by the attachment.
   The displayed `k=16` boundary arithmetic is only one boundary check; a
   uniform monotonic or prime-counting argument is still required before the
   one-owner elimination can be accepted.
6. The fixed-`k`, fixed-support finiteness theorem is not a large-`k`
   closure. The attachment itself correctly leaves a uniform family of
   bounded nonzero-resultant candidates and integer roots of `Q_S`.

## Existing kernel-checked Lean interfaces

The nearest banked interfaces are:

- `matched_owner_local_coefficients_dvd_sq`
- `canonicalOwnerCell_dvd_shiftedDifference`
- `large_prime_has_unique_full_exponent_owner_cell`
- `blockProduct_le_smallLoss_mul_kLargePart`
- `blockProduct_dvd_factorial_mul_centeredDiffLcm_four`
- `owner_shiftedLocalQuotient_coboundary`

The new normalized module now defines the row binomials and reduced ratios.
It does not yet define `D_k,U_S,V_S,Phi_S,Q_S`, specialize the original
factorial owner-square theorem, or imply the claimed square-Hermite and
ordinary matching resultants.

## Required Lean interfaces before import

```text

## Import decision

- Accepted into the repository: this audit report and its exact repair map.
- Accepted into `Audit.lean` / `proofs.yaml`: none of the attachment's new
  certificate-dependent large-`k` claims. The repaired normalization layer
  and the exact reduced-binomial bounds were independently reconstructed and
  are now kernel-banked.
- Next formalization priority: the row-binomial lcm identity and the
  binomial specialization of the repaired normalized owner-square
  equivalence.
- Repository-scale support enumeration: not authorized and not started.
