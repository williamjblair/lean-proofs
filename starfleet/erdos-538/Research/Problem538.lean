# Erdős Problem 538: pinned finite formulation

This file fixes the exact finite objects in the problem.  A proposed *exact*
answer is a function `B : ℕ → ℕ → ℚ` together with a proof of
`SolvesExactly B`.  We keep the extremal predicate separate because the phrase
"best possible upper bound" is sometimes used only up to asymptotic order.
Any asymptotic final theorem must still use `Admissible` and `reciprocalMass`
below and must contain both an upper bound and matching admissible witnesses.

/-- All solution pairs `(p,a)` of `m = p*a` with `p` prime and `a ∈ A`.
The range `m+1` is exhaustive: a prime in such a solution is at most `m`,
because members of an admissible `A` are positive. -/

/-- `B` is the pointwise best upper bound for the fixed parameters `r,N`.
The second conjunct is sharpness.  Since there are finitely many subsets of
`{1,...,N}`, the supremum is attained, so equality is the faithful finite
notion of "best possible". -/
