/-- Abstract weighted pair-witness double count.

For every index `i`, suppose there are at least `k * gap i` distinct witness
labels.  Suppose also that every label witnessing `i` has weight at least
`c * gap i`, and that a fixed label `z` witnesses at most `cap z` indices.
Then the total squared-gap mass is controlled by the weighted capacities.

In the periodic divisor-sieve application, labels are short pairs of ranked
forbidden moduli, their weight is the smaller one-shifted rank, and `cap` is
the exact number of compatible CRT classes in one period. -/
