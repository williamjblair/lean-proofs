# FRONTIER.md — the Erdős portfolio

One page per campaign state: what is proved (kernel-verified, axioms ⊆
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, attested in
`attestations.json`), what is open (stated exactly), and what is
refuted (with witnesses — do not re-attempt). This file is the master
dashboard, the source for external proof-attempt prompts (`codex/`),
and the intended seed corpus for the Vela frontier ingest.

Verification discipline (applies to every claim entering this repo):
generation is untrusted; claims pass through (1) exact-arithmetic
reproduction, (2) adversarial audit against the falsification record,
(3) Lean formalization behind the axiom gate, (4) attestation. See

## Erdős #686 — N = 4 has no equal-length block-quotient representation

Status: OPEN upstream; here packaged as one exact residual hypothesis
equivalent to the two updated targets.
Docs: `PROGRESS_Erdos686.md`. Modules: `ErdosProblems/Erdos686*.lean`.

UNCONDITIONAL: every admissible `k ≤ 15` case with `k ≤ d < 10^120`
(Runge + mod-p covers for even k; Farey descent for odd k), and now every odd target row throughout
`10^120 ≤ d < 10^1000`; the k=14 case for all d; the complete large rows
`k=16,18,20,24,28,32`.  The theorem `erdos686_false_of_finalResidual` is the
conditional terminal reduction from the still-open equivalent residual.

NEW BANKED RESTRICTIONS: exact p-adic square localization for every
`p^e|d`, `p≥k` (cubic at an odd center), giving
`p^(2e)<A_k d` with `A_k=14,17,23,26,29,35`; hence dominant components
are impossible.  Valuation concentration supplies the missing small-prime
case: for every prime base, a whole gap `d=p^e≥10^120` is impossible in
all six odd rows.  The exact loss is bounded by
`14! * 35 * 13^30 < 10^120`.  Reflection compression is kernel-checked.
The exact equation also has a global quadratic lift: with
`X_i=3(n+i)-d`, coefficient cancellation in
`prod(X_i+4d)=4 prod(X_i+d)` gives
`d^2 | prod_i X_i` with no prime-base or localization exception.
Global residual concentration now cleans every prime-power component,
including bases `2` and `3`, into a square divisor of one residual with an
explicit loss.  Combining two such components with second and third local
Taylor lifts closes **every** gap having exactly two distinct prime divisors
below `10^120`; no `p,q>=k` hypothesis remains.  Thus any surviving odd-tail
gap has at least three distinct prime divisors.  The same obstruction
calculus closes an arbitrary supplied pair of coprime cleaned owner buckets
under the exact all-prime loss table
`G_k=108,1620,136080,1224720,242494560,18914575680`: an exact solution
equipped with `HasAtMostTwoGlobalResidualOwners` has `d<10^120`.  This is a
strict conditional interface, but the finite prime-factor grouping step is
now kernel-banked: global concentration constructs one certified assignment,
and any two-index cover of its nonzero cleaned owner range constructs the
predicate and contradicts the cutoff.  Consequently every target-size
solution has a certified assignment whose nonzero cleaned range cannot be
covered by two indices.  The finite negative-cover argument is now
kernel-banked through an explicit witness: in that same assignment there are
three distinct prime factors with nonzero cleaned exponents, pairwise-distinct
owners, pairwise-coprime cleaned powers, factor divisibility, and square
residual divisibility.  This is an at-least-three witness, not an
exactly-three decomposition when more owners remain.  For three cleaned
residual buckets, exact second-
and third-order eliminations are kernel-banked and all
1,035 target index triples have distinct zero slopes.  The exact fourth local
lift is now banked as well: each cleaned component supplies one cubic
owner-adic obstruction, and the three cyclic obstructions compose modulo
`P^3,Q^3,R^3`.  A Hensel/CRT family with 121-digit gap satisfies the square,
moment, and all local congruences through fourth order while failing both the
equation and short window, so the exact remaining three-bucket node is
archimedean/short-CRT rather than a finite resultant.
The former zero-obstruction wrapper is now repaired and hostile-audited:
for a supplied bounded-loss three-bucket factorization at target size, none
of the three composed second obstructions can vanish.  Its historical
noncompiling source audit remains recorded separately; only the repaired
source is attested.  The surviving three-bucket branch therefore has all
three second obstructions nonzero.  Fourth-to-third quotient cancellation,
the fixed-coefficient reduced congruence, opposite-cofactor overlap, the
three-row lattice identity, and generic two-zero packing are also
kernel-banked and independently hostile-audited.  Exact arithmetic closes
all 1,420 noncentral two-zero placements through `k=13` and 901 of 1,183 at
`k=15` at the historical `10^120` cutoff.  Those 282 old numerical
survivors, the one-zero cells, and the center-zero cells are no longer live:
the exact-ratio theorem proves every composed third obstruction nonzero from
the equation, and its quotient-form corollary proves every named third
quotient nonzero.  Independent arithmetic confirms that `10^131` already
closes all 2,603 historical noncentral two-zero placements, but the live
proof uses nonvanishing rather than this finite scan.  The old 2,381-cell and
boundary sign census is therefore superseded.  After the 27 reflected
triples are removed, the exactly-three branch consists of 1,008
nonreflected, all-three-nonzero, sign-mixed geometries.
At the upgraded odd-tail cutoff, the separate center/reflected determinant
route now closes every one of the 27 reflected pairs for a supplied exact
three-bucket factorization: Lean derives the center and endpoint packing
bounds from the equation, and exact arithmetic puts every cutoff below
`10^200<10^1000` (12 old pairs and 15 new).  This does not construct an
exactly-three decomposition when more live owners remain, nor does it turn
an arbitrary three-owner geometry into a center/reflected one.
The fifth lift is now normalized exactly rather than treated as a possible
fixed resultant.  Lean proves `R5(d)=27*K4+d*R1+d^2*R2`; after writing
`d=P*M` and the reduced fourth numerator as `P*w`, the reduced fifth square
divisibility is equivalent to `P|27*w+M*R1*g^4`.  The new fourth quotient
`w` is not controlled by the third-quotient lattice.  Lean now also proves
the exact opposite-product bound, the induced bounds
`|w|<W*g^4*M`, `|N|<V*g^4*M`, the nonzero-divisible consequence
`P^2<V*g^4*d`, and the eliminant identity `d^4*P*N=g^4*J(X,d)`.
Independent exact arithmetic finds `w,N!=0` in all 3,024 cyclic positions of
the 1,008 nonreflected triples at the live cutoff, but that finite ledger is
not called kernel-banked because it has no ordinary-kernel wrapper.  The
three component-square bounds still multiply with the wrong gap exponent.
Exact Hensel fixtures
at 121- and 1,004-digit gaps satisfy the entire congruence package while
failing the equation and upper window, so no congruence-only fixed
resultant is counted.
The complete owner grid is now assembled end to end.  From the equation and
target-size hypothesis, Lean constructs `AllOwnerAssemblyCertificate` with
one bucket for every index in `Icc 1 k` (unit buckets where empty), the
unchanged bounded cleaning loss, exact gap product, positive exact residual
cofactors and step-three differences, and every second/third finite-family
divisibility.  Every composed second obstruction is nonzero.  This removes
the earlier unproved passage from an at-least-three witness to a complete
owner decomposition.  It is a compositional bridge, not a resolution: the
joint nonzero obstruction/short-window branch still requires a new bound.
Two additional global moment identities use `2^2=4` to make
`d^3` divide explicit constant-plus-linear coefficient combinations.  They
are cubic combinations, not cubic divisibility of either residual product.
For `k≥16`, the
ratio window gives both `n>9d` and `kd<5n`.  Maximum-valuation owner
matching across the exact lower and upper blocks compresses the whole lower
block into `(k-1)!` times the lcm of
`d-k+1,...,d+k-1`, including all small prime bases.  This forces two explicit
lcm transition inequalities but does not close large `d`, because the host
interval still has `2k-1` possible differences.  A second composition uses
the reflection center `S=2n+d+k+1`: after the parity coefficient and one
factorial loss, every residual prime power lands on lower and upper owners
`i,j` and divides `|i+j-(k+1)|`.  Non-reflected pairs land in
`lcm(1,...,k-1)`; the exact surviving alternative is the reflected alignment
`j=k+1-i`.  Aggregating the lower landing proves the distinct necessary
divisibility `S | reflectionCoeff(k)*(k-1)!*reflectionDiffLcm(k,d)`.
Every lower term is
composite, and the
published Nair-Shorey `4.42k` theorem closes the paper-level wedge
`50(d+k-1)≤221k`; only the downstream implication is in Lean because
the external theorem itself is not formalized.

NEW EVEN-ROW AND VALUATION CLOSURES: for every `r≥2`, Lean now constructs
the rational polynomial part of the square root of the centered even-row
polynomial, clears denominators, proves the deficit nonzero from its simple
root at one, and produces an explicit coefficient threshold `M_r`.  The
equation is impossible for `k=2r` and `d≥max(2r,M_r)`.  Separate integral
traps and ordinary-kernel finite-field covers close every admissible gap in
rows `k=16,18,20,24,28,32`; the k=18, k=28, and k=32 covers are split into
bounded shards and use no `native_decide`.  Centered pairing and an exact seven-term root bracket
sharpen the large-row ratio window to `1218443kd<1853952n`.
Every lower-block endpoint that is a prime power is impossible for every
prime.  At an interior position the exact split-factorial valuation criterion
is banked; in particular, every prime power with base `p>k` is excluded.
More generally a single large-base owner `a*p^A` is excluded for
`3707904a≤1218443k`.
Exact `p=2` and `p=3` fixtures show why the unrestricted interior statement
would be false.
Every large-row equation also forces the exact gap-component ceiling
`6p^(2e)<(13k-6)d+18(k-1)` for every `p^e|d` with prime `p≥k`.
The small-base gap is now closed at the component level as well.  For every
prime `p` and exact component `p^e || d` with `p^e≥k`, the Lean-banked public
dispatcher `no_four_solution_of_highPrimePower_component` excludes the three
canonical dominance ranges

```text
p=2:  (13k-6)d+18(k-1) ≤ 24*2^(2e-lambda_2(k));
p=3:  (13k-6)d+18(k-1) ≤  6*3^(2e-mu_3(k,e)-1);
p≥5:  (13k-6)d+18(k-1) ≤  6*p^(2e-lambda_p(k)).
```

The separate branch theorems for two, three, and primes at least five, plus
their residual-lift witnesses, all compile with exactly
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.  Thus a surviving large-row
solution must satisfy the strict reverse inequality for every full component
at least `k`.  The corollary `no_four_solution_primePowerGap` also kernel-closes
the explicit family `d=p^(k+t)` for every prime `p`, every `k≥16`, and every
natural `t,n`.  This is a proper uniform restriction, not the full solution:
gaps whose components all miss their thresholds remain.
For any supplied positive modulus `q` with matched lower and upper owners
`n+i=a*q` and `n+d+j=(a+b)*q`, the sharp window first gives
`1218443*k*b<3707904*a`, hence `0<b<a`.  Lean then proves that `q` divides
the exact signed linear residual `D`.  If `D!=0`, this yields the explicit
cofactor-sensitive gap bound
`1218443*k*d < 3707904*a^2*(C_j+2*C_i)`.  If `D=0`, gcd normalization gives
`a=B*w`, `a+b=A*w`, `B<A<2B`, and `Z=w*q`; the next coefficient
`c2=A^2*E_j-4*B^2*E_i` is nonzero, `Z|c2`, and
`d≤(A-B)*|c2|+k-1`.  The abstract odd-center equality with ratio four is the
essential excluded boundary.  This dichotomy is arbitrary-modulus and
kernel-banked, but it is conditional on a supplied matched owner: no banked
theorem yet supplies a contradiction-producing owner or aggregates the
surviving nonzero-residual edges.
Consequently every whole gap `d=p^e` with `e≥2` is impossible, as is every
whole prime-power gap with `d≥3k`.  The same ceiling applies to every
complete cleaned owner bucket.  Thus a whole two-large-prime gap
`d=p^e q^f` with distinct bases `p,q≥k` must have distinct lower owners.
For every odd `k≥17`, Lean then constructs the uniform `A=3k+2` Pell and
second-lift certificate for that distinct-owner branch.  The classical
Sylvester--Schur theorem is now vendored and kernel-checked, and Lean proves
that the reflected harmonic value forced by simultaneous zero obstructions
is never integral for any odd `k≥5`.  The coefficient-algebra bridge is also
Lean-banked: for distinct owners, the two exact second obstructions cannot
vanish simultaneously.  Finally, in every
row `k=p^a-1`, `p≥5`, neither endpoint parameter is divisible by `p^a`.
These are proper restrictions; the surviving nonzero-obstruction Pell branch
and mixed small-prime gaps remain open.

CONSECUTIVE-PART MASS: stripping all primes above `k` preserves the exact
factor four, while the lower stripped product is divisible by `k!`; both
facts are kernel-banked.  The published Erdős-Lacampagne-Selfridge bounded
classification then forces a split rough-owner graph and, beyond an explicit
threshold, one spanning component or two even half-size components.  This
last classification is recorded paper-level because ELS Theorem 4 is not
formalized.  An exact reflection-compatible four-cycle survives ordering,
row divisibility, `n>9d`, and reflection, failing only the lower ratio window;
there is no hidden alternating-cycle determinant.

ODD-TAIL ROUTE AUDIT: a complete exact `k=5` counterfamily refutes the
first two primitive-scale congruences as an unbounded closure mechanism.
The surviving floor pin `g²=floor(5A₃/A₅)` is proper but does not control
the infinite CF tail.  Imposing the discriminant square reconstructs the
original smooth genus-6 plane quintic (genus-2 sign quotient), so that
cover is target-strength rather than a lower-genus reduction.

OPEN CORE (the two arms below are equivalently packaged as the single
`FinalResidual686Hypothesis`):
1. `OddThueTail1000Hypothesis` — for odd k ∈ {5..15}, no solution with
   d ≥ 10^1000. Each tail extends ~1 decade per 2 CF terms; unbounded
   closure needs effective irrationality for 4^{1/k} below Liouville
   (none exists; hypergeometric method structurally fails at these k)
   or new CF structure. Watch: Calegari–Dimitrov–Tang holonomy program.
   The one- and two-distinct-prime-support subcases are now excluded for
   every prime base.  The remaining gap has at least three distinct prime
   divisors.  For arbitrary prime support, finite factorization, owner choice,
   coprime bucket assembly, and `g<=G_k` are now banked.  The certified
   assignment of any target-size solution has three explicit distinct
   nonzero cleaned owner witnesses; the remaining task is to contradict that
   multi-owner branch.  The extraction does not absorb further owner buckets
   into the bounded loss.
   In the exactly-three-cleaned-bucket slice, every second and third
   obstruction is nonzero, and the quotient-form theorem excludes every
   zero third quotient already from `d>=10^120`.  At the live `10^1000`
   boundary the center/reflected determinant removes 27 triples, leaving
   exactly 1,008 nonreflected all-three-nonzero geometries.  For arbitrary
   complete owner families of
   cardinality `4..15`, exact second/third obstruction composition with the
   original loss is now banked, and the equation-level lower residual bound
   excludes every vanishing composed second obstruction at target size.
   The surviving multi-owner branch has every second obstruction nonzero;
   direct obstruction-size bounds grow with the family and do not close it.
   The complete-grid bridge is now kernel-banked: every target solution
   supplies an `AllOwnerAssemblyThirdNonzeroCertificate`, including all empty
   and live owner buckets without absorbing omitted components into the loss,
   and every composed second and third obstruction is nonzero.  The
   exact remaining odd arm is to exclude the 1,008 nonreflected
   exactly-three supports and all 42,274 supports of cardinality at least
   four at `d>=10^1000`.  Equivalently, any target-row equation carrying the
   full certificate must have `d<10^1000`; this is target-strength and is not
   counted as a further reduction.
   For the complete owner grid, all 42,274 subsets and 2,576 four-owner
   circuits have now been checked exactly; every circuit is sign-mixed.  The
   unique product-square Vandermonde resultant retains the common cofactor
   product and becomes the degree-three truncation of the original equation.
   Its apparent fourth-power divisibility is therefore tautological from the
   `d^4` remainder and supplies no hidden cutoff.
2. The restricted large-row arm — no remaining k ≥ 16 equation after removing
   `k=16,18,20,24,28,32`, every even tail above its explicit `M_r`, the exact
   split-factorial prime-power families, and every large-base owner
   `a*p^A` with `3707904a≤1218443k`.  The equation itself already supplies
   smoothness, `1218443kd<1853952n`, the component and grouped-owner square
   ceilings, the strict all-prime high-component thresholds, and the
   prime-power boundary restrictions.  The census fixtures remain
   non-equations and do not discharge this arm.

Lean proves that this single residual hypothesis implies the former
`OddThueTailHypothesis`, `LargeKSmoothHypothesis`, and the full refutation.
It also proves the converse from the updated odd-tail and smoothness
hypotheses, so this is equivalent packaging rather than a weaker reduction.
The residual nonexistence statement is still open and is not counted as a
solution merely because it has been isolated.

## Erdős #617 — Erdős–Gyárfás balanced-coloring conjecture

Status: r ≤ 4 known (1999); r = 5 UNDER ACTIVE DECISION (live fleet).
Docs: `PROGRESS_Erdos617.md`; live logs `compute617/sat_log.md`.
Module: `ErdosProblems/Erdos617.lean` (deletion/extension framework).

PROVED: counterexample classes are (6,6)-Ramsey graphs; affine family
exactly empty; silent classes need ≥ 76 edges ⟹ two-silent case
closed; ≥ 4 classes need ≥ 59 edges; the conditional reduction
`statement_five_of_extension_demand`.

OPEN: the r = 5 verdict (in flight: SMS direct + decisive legs +
sub-cube swarm, zero SAT anywhere); then the uniform-r generalization
(extension-demand lemmas for all r) — the full-solve path.

## Erdős #23 — triangle-free bipartization ≤ N²/25

Status: OPEN; exact result claimed for N ≤ 200 (arXiv:2606.28041) —
verified here bit-for-bit except one unpublished solver-history file.
Dirs: `compute23/` (gates 1–3).

PROVED HERE: the connected-B inequality Γ ≤ N² checked on 49.7M
instances (N ≤ 13); equality cases are ALL balanced odd-cycle blow-ups
C_{2k+1}[q] (infinite two-parameter family — the true reason all
certificates self-tighten); sandwich theorem: universal Lemma RL is
conjecture-strength; RL proved on trees, s ≤ 1, and now for every
`|M|=1` instance.  The former gap G-A is closed by a symmetric
two-demand component ledger (complete paper proof, two hostile audits,
exact structural replay).  Lean now constructs and checks the bridge-cut reduction,
geodesic coordinates, canonical off-corridor components, exact `q_C/r_C`
partition sums, attachment spans, ridden-index/owner counting, and the
ordinary/exceptional local charge, including the simultaneous canonical
ride/excursion assignment and the repaired exceptional tail.  The final
kernel theorem `gapGA_symmetric_bounds` proves both SE1 and SE2.  A new
series-composition reduction first closed every remaining RL* instance
containing an interior stub-geodesic bridge whose two components each have
at least four vertices.  The exact partner-distance gate now extends this to
all three-vertex sides; a two-vertex side retracts as an M-free endpoint
leaf.  Endpoint corridor bridges are also closed, either by small-block
retraction or by absorbing the endpoint block's `a^2` Gamma allowance into
the exact RL budget.  Hence every corridor bridge is eliminated.  For a
fully nonbridge root-stub geodesic, the canonical attachment intervals give
the new kernel bounds `d ≤ 2s` and, in the `n ≥ 14` residual, `s ≥ 5`.
At the equality boundary `d = 2s`, those intervals are forced to be a chain
of singleton even tiles.  Lean now constructs the `s-1` capacity-two block
cuts, proves that RFC leaves capacity one for internal demands, and derives
the exact cut-count distance bound, including terminal endpoints by
bipartite parity.  The theorem
`totalCost_le_rlBudget_of_doubleSlack_allNonbridge_sameSide` therefore closes
the full bridge-free equality slice.  The next row `d = 2s-1` is also
kernel-closed: the canonical interval ledger has one mass, span, or overlap
defect; bipartiteness excludes span, and the two surviving geometries yield
a literal one-high binary BFS chain.  The theorem
`totalCost_le_rlBudget_of_oneDefect_allNonbridge_sameSide` proves exact
demand alignment and the RL budget.  Independently, the complete
two-demand strict-residual slice with either distance four is kernel-closed
by `totalCost_le_rlBudget_of_twoDemands_existsDistanceFour`.
The two-demand long-slack slice `2d<s` is also kernel-closed by
`totalCost_le_rlBudget_of_twoDemands_twoLength_lt_slack`: the proof combines
rooted and internal-pair G-A inequalities at quadratic strength and therefore
survives the false joint-sum fixture.  For even root distance, the partner-two
version also closes the four rows `2d-3<=s<=2d`.
The hostile audit includes the `n=14`, distances `[4,4]`, and `n=17`,
distances `[4,6]`, middle-regime fixtures plus every killed aggregation
fixture.

OPEN CORE: BF-RL, the multi-edge aggregation G-B / inductive RL* in the exact
region `n ≥ 14`, `5 ≤ s`, `d ≤ 2s-2`, `2sp(d) < (d+1)²`, `|M| ≥ 2`, with a
chosen root-stub geodesic whose every edge is a nonbridge.  This is still
weaker than assuming the whole cut graph is 2-connected.  No target-strength
joint aggregation is asserted.  An exact kernel-checked coarea theorem now
turns RFC into total-variation domination for every integer vertex potential,
providing a weighted-cut dual interface but not the missing quadratic
certificate.  `compute23/gate3/gap_gb_joint_findings.md`
and `gap_gb_joint_audit.md` give the exact proof and remaining quantified
lemma.

The proposed two-demand shortcut `D1+D2<=n+p(d)-2` has now been decisively
falsified inside this same live region: an exact `n=76,d=11,s=64,p=1`
all-nonbridge RFC fixture has distances `(38,38)`, so `76>75`, while its
actual RL cost remains far below budget (`3042<=5760`).  The two-demand core
therefore requires a quadratic or geometry-sensitive invariant rather than
that linear sum bound.

## Erdős #699 — common prime factor p ≥ i of C(n,i), C(n,j)

Status: OPEN ("probably very deep" — Erdős). Docs:

i ≤ 2 banked; i = 3 reduced to a split/gcd obstruction with the

re-injected). Small-i j ~ n/2 core is anti-concentration over all
large primes — parked.

## Erdős #730 — same prime support of consecutive central binomials

Status: claimed proof AUDITED; its decisive uniform incomplete-block
lemma is FALSE as quantified.  On the Q branch, `a=2r` makes the map
affine modulo `p^(2r)`, and translated intervals contain exponentially
more restricted outputs than the claimed density, even after retaining
the exact valuation.  A stronger progression construction fixes the low
`s=max(2r-a,0)` output digits first and extends the obstruction through
`s/r<kappa_p/(1-kappa_p)`.  Its exact `p=5,r=432,s=176` witness lies in the
former separated range and refutes the proposed signed Fourier inequality
itself by a factor above `1.164`.  This does not refute Erdős #730.  The
maximal-r valuation payment has therefore been enlarged uniformly to the
full strict high-valuation band `s<r`; it remains paper-proved and
exact-audited below `0.01` for every `X>=2^57`.  The band forces
`r+1<=a`, so Lean checks the clean threshold `X<2B^2(p^a)^2`, dyadic step
certificates, and the exact endpoint payment `0.0048569067...`.  The infinite reciprocal-tail
aggregation and real root/floor monotonic transfer remain outside the kernel;
the corrected aligned-block argument now pays the full higher-power part
`2<=a<=r` of the complementary range by less than `174/625`, across all four
branches.  The sharper `6/5` endpoint normalization, exact quadratic block
identity, and terminal budget arithmetic are kernel-banked; the digit count,
166-prime rational certificate, tail, and branch aggregation remain
paper/exact rather than kernel-expanded.  The only unpaid exponent slice is
maximal-`r` `a=1`; together with an explicitly defined short/top contribution
it must total at most `1779/2500-delta`.  The intake must also prove the common
event-multiplicity coverage bridge before summing those categories.  Exact
sparse Gauss completion is
audited, but its triangle majorant is exponentially insufficient for
`p=5,7,11`; a new signed estimate with a payable error is required.  Bonus
banked: 1,556 certified consecutive
pairs via the sound Kummer criterion.
