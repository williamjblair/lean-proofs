## 0. Executive status

[R] The refutation of Erdős #686 is now machine-checked down to exactly two
open hypotheses. In `ErdosProblems/Erdos686SmallBranch.lean`:

```lean
theorem erdos686_false_of_constant_bound_and_large_escape
    (hbound : ConstantCaseBoundHypothesis)
    (hlarge : LargeKEscapeHypothesis) :
    ¬ ∀ N : ℕ, 2 ≤ N → ∃ k n m : ℕ, 2 ≤ k ∧ m ≥ n + k ∧
      (N : ℚ) = (∏ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 k, ((m + i : ℕ) : ℚ)) /
                (∏ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 k, ((n + i : ℕ) : ℚ))
```

[R] CI gate: 501 manifest-tracked theorems (445 for problem 686), 501
regenerated attestations, and 927 headline theorem surfaces with axioms
contained in `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` after the audited #730
unit-range block spine.

[R] **All pure prime-power odd tails are closed.**  The p-adic lift module
now proves that for every prime `p`, exponent `e`, and
`k ∈ {5,7,9,11,13,15}`, the equation has no solution when
`d=p^e≥10^120`.  For `p≥k` this is the clean localized square lift; for
`p<k`, a maximum-valuation factor loses at most
`1+v_p((k-1)!)`, and the exact residual bound is dominated by
`14! * 35 * 13^30 < 10^120`.  This removes the entire one-prime-support
regime but does not close mixed-prime gaps.

[R] **The whole gap square lands in one residual progression.**  Put
`X_i=3(n+i)-d`.  The exact equation is

```text
product_i (X_i+4d) = 4 product_i (X_i+d).
```

The constant terms differ by three, the linear terms cancel, and every
higher coefficient `4^r-4` is divisible by three.  Lean therefore proves
unconditionally that `d^2 | product_i X_i`, plus a positive natural-number
wrapper in the live range.  This removes the derivative-coefficient loss
before any new primewise concentration; it is a proper consequence, not yet
a mixed-prime closure.

[R] **Every two-distinct-prime gap is closed.**  The global square lift now
cleans each `p^e|d` into a component `h` with `h|d`, `h|n+i`, and
`h^2|3(n+i)-d`.  The exact loss is at most `64` for `p≠3` and `59049` for
`p=3`; the latter is proved by removing the common three from the whole
residual progression.  For `d=p^e q^f`, same-owner components multiply as
coprime squares.  Distinct owners satisfy the cleaned Pell relation and
second local obstructions; simultaneous reflected zeros are repaired by the
third local lift with exact coefficient `20`.  The fully composed Lean
theorem gives `d<10^120` for all distinct primes `p,q`, including `2,3`,
without a base-size hypothesis.  Any surviving odd tail therefore has at
least three distinct prime divisors.

[R] **The finite at-most-two-owner branch is closed end to end.**  For all
prime bases at once, the exact aggregate cleaning
loss is

```text
k:    5     7       9        11          13             15
G_k: 108  1620  136080  1224720  242494560  18914575680.
```

If the cleaned mass is supplied as two coprime owner buckets `P,Q` with
`d=gPQ`, `g<=G_k`, the second obstruction is below `10^16 g^2`; if both
second obstructions vanish, the third lifts and the cleaned Pell gcd cancel
the opposite coefficients.  Lean proves that the resulting exact equation
has `d<10^120`, including coincident owners and unit buckets.  The theorem
takes `HasAtMostTwoGlobalResidualOwners` as an explicit analytic interface.
The new finite grouping module constructs it from any certified per-prime
assignment covered by two indices: it proves the exact factorization, bucket
coprimality, factor and square divisibilities, and `g<=G_k`.  Global
concentration then chooses one assignment for every solution.  At target
size, that same assignment cannot be covered by any two indices.  Thus the
remaining branch has more than two nonzero cleaned owner values; the old
bookkeeping interface is no longer open.

[R] **Three cleaned buckets have exact second/third restrictions, but no
closure.**  For `d=gPQR` and three step-three square residuals, Lean proves
`P|3(C_iabc-12D_ig^2(i-j)(i-l))` and the companion square divisibility
`P^2|-3O_i+180E_ig^2(i-j)(i-l)d`, cyclically.  Exact arithmetic checks all
1,035 index triples and 5,216 signed fixtures.  A 121-digit CRT construction
satisfies this congruence package and both global moments but is explicitly
not an equation solution and exceeds the verified short window.  The live
three-bucket gap is the quantified short-CRT lemma, not a claimed resultant.

[R] **Two global cubic moment combinations.**  Expanding at the evaluation
ratio `2^2=4` cancels every term through degree two after explicit constant
and linear corrections.  Lean proves `d^3` divides the resulting
combinations for both residual progressions `n+i-d` and `3(n+i)+d`.  The
exact solution `(k,n,d)=(1,0,3)` shows why the correction is load-bearing:
neither raw residual product is divisible by `27`.

[R] **Large-k maximum-valuation owners compress to one lcm.**  For every
exact equation with `k>=1` and `d>=k`,

```text
B(k,n) | (k-1)! * lcm(d-k+1,...,d+k-1).
```

The row skeleton alone gives the same statement with two factorial
allowances.  In the large branch the exact ratio also sharpens to `kd<5n`,
forcing `(kd)^k < 5^k (k-1)! C(k,d)`.  Both named deep row-prefix fixtures
and the `d=1` telescopes pass the hostile audit.  The result is a proper
compression, not a closure: generic lcm mass still has `2k-1` possible hosts
and grows with degree `2k-1` in `d`.

[R] **Reflection and matching owners now correlate prime by prime.**  Put
`S=2n+d+k+1`.  For every prime `p`, after subtracting the valuation of the
parity coefficient and one `(k-1)!` loss, an exact equation supplies lower
and upper owners `i,j` on which the same residual power lands.  It divides
both a reflected difference and a centered difference, hence
`|i+j-(k+1)|`; a non-reflected pair is absorbed by
`lcm(1,...,k-1)`.  The exact obstruction is `j=k+1-i`, which is exhibited by
the audited synthetic fixtures and is not closed.  Independently, Lean
aggregates the lower landing to
`S | reflectionCoeff(k)*(k-1)!*reflectionDiffLcm(k,d)`.  This and the older
full reflection product are structurally incomparable, so neither is
presented as uniformly sharper.

[X] **The former large-branch target is falsified.** The fixed-prefix
statement `RowSixteenBoundaryHypothesis` (rows 1..15 divide ⟹ row 16 fails)
is FALSE: the exact-window point `(k, n, d) = (984, 3177026, 4480)` passes
rows 1..16; only row 17 fails (`n+17 = 439·7237`, and 7237 exceeds the row-17
interval maximum 5447). Banked as `row_sixteen_boundary_hypothesis_false`
(kernel-verified witness). Deep survivor clusters (n = 48502 fails first at
row 16; n = 3177026 at row 17) show fixed-prefix caps cannot work; the
repaired open target is the unrestricted escape.

[R] **k = 14 closed entirely** (all d ≥ 221): the Runge trap confines
`m = T₁₄(w) − 2T₁₄(v)` to 834 candidates, all killed by a 31-prime
mod-p set cover (`Erdos686FourteenStrip.lean`).  All even
`k ∈ {6, 8, 10, 12, 14}` are unconditional.

[R] **Equation-level prime obstruction** (`Erdos686PrimeObstruction.lean`):
a prime `q ≥ d + k` dividing any block element refutes the equation in
five lines.  Hence any solution has both blocks entirely
`(d+k)`-smooth; the large-`k` core is now `LargeKSmoothHypothesis`.

[R] **The Thue route (odd k)**: centered variables `X = n+d+(k+1)/2`,
`Y = n+(k+1)/2` turn the equation into `P_k(X) = 4·P_k(Y)` with `P_k`
odd; the leading cancellation forces `|4^{1/k} − X/Y| ≤ C_k/Y²`
(C₅ = 61/100, C₇ = 399/500, C₉ = 1031/1000, C₁₁ = 13/10, C₁₃ = 3/2,
C₁₅ = 1729/1000 — all exact, proved chains).  A C-agnostic
Stern–Brocot descent certificate (`Erdos686ConvergentMachinery.lean`,
no reals, no Mathlib CF, kernel decide ~1s) confines and refutes every
candidate.  **k = 5 is banked closed for 221 ≤ d < 10^120**
(`Erdos686FiveThue.lean`) — the community had k = 5 open;
k ∈ {7, 9, 11, 13, 15} are also banked to the same `10^120` threshold.
Telescope caveat: k = 9, 15 have d = 1
polynomial identities (`P₉(8) = 4·P₉(7)`), excluded by the domain.

[C] The open hypotheses (the entire remaining mathematical content):

```lean
-- per odd k: no equation solution at astronomical heights
def NoLargeGapSolutionFour (k B : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ n d : ℕ, B ≤ d → blockProduct k (n + d) ≠ 4 * blockProduct k n
-- six tails: NoLargeGapSolutionFour k (10^120-ish), k ∈ {5,7,9,11,13,15}

def LargeKSmoothHypothesis : Prop :=                 -- large-k core
  ∀ k n d : ℕ, 16 ≤ k → k ≤ d →
    blockProduct k (n + d) = 4 * blockProduct k n →
    (∀ i, i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 k → ∀ q, q.Prime → q ∣ n + i → q < d + k) →
    False
```

[R] **The terminal reduction is banked**
(`Erdos686FinalReduction.lean`):

```lean
theorem erdos686_false_of_thue_tails_and_smooth
    (htails : OddThueTailHypothesis)     -- six tails at d ≥ 10^120
    (hsmooth : LargeKSmoothHypothesis) : -- k ≥ 16 double smoothness
    ¬ (universal Erdős 686 statement)
```

with the UNCONDITIONAL `no_gap_solution_four_small_k_below`: for every
`5 ≤ k ≤ 15` and `221 ≤ d < 10^120` the `N = 4` equation is
impossible.  All five odd-k Thue modules reached full 10^120 depth.
Every intermediate conditional reduction remains banked and audited.

## 1. Architecture (revised from the earlier GPT Pro plan)

The earlier 13-tuple quotient-confinement plan collapsed to something much
simpler once the row→residual reduction was proved parametrization-only:

[R] `residual_dvd_of_row_dvd` (Erdos686ConstantQuotient.lean) needs only
`n + 1 = (q+1)·d − u`, NOT that `q` is each row's true quotient. The per-factor
identity is exact in ℤ: `q·(d + (1+s) − (t+1)) − M = q·s − R_t` where
`M = n+1+t`, `R_t = d−u+(q+1)t`. Consequently:

- only the **row-1 quotient** `(n+1)/d` needs confining (banked:
  `row_base_quotient_confined_of_window`, one value per k, two for k = 9);
- the k = 13 exceptional tuple (8,8,8,9) is absorbed by the (13,8) constant
  case;
- the single exceptional branch (9, quotient 5) is a finite box
  (`u ∈ [1,6], d ≤ 1421`), banked closed (`k_nine_quotient_five_row_escape`).

[R] The **u = d top edge** (`n+1 = q·d`, missed by all earlier scans because
they used `u < d`) is window-feasible only for (9,6), d ≤ 1613, passes the
t = 0 residual trivially (`residualRowPoly 9 6 0 = 0`), and is banked closed
(`constant_u_eq_d_no_prefix_three`).

Small-k pipeline (all banked; `Erdos686SmallBranch.lean` assembles):
`d ≤ 220` finite core → else confinement → (9,5)-box / constant case →
deficiency `u` → residuals t = 0..3 → [OPEN bound] → survivor membership →
row-4 escape → contradiction.

## 2. Banked modules (this session)

| Module | Content |

## 3. The 11 constant cases and the bound table

```text
(k,q): (5,3) (6,3) (7,4) (8,5) (9,6) (10,6) (11,7) (12,8) (13,8) (14,9) (15,10)
bound:  220   220   220   220   220   266    7029   2695   4467   2811   2915
```

[E] Evidence for `ConstantCaseBoundHypothesis` (exact scans, q-relaxed
residual form = the form used in Lean):

```text
k = 5..9:   d ≤ 1e8,  zero three-row survivors with d ≥ 221
k = 10:     d ≤ 3e8,  3 survivors, max d 266
k = 11:     d ≤ 1e9,  7 survivors, max d 7029
k = 12:     d ≤ 3e8,  5 survivors, max d 2695
k = 13:     d ≤ 1e9,  7 survivors, max d 4467
k = 14:     d ≤ 3e8, 10 survivors, max d 2811
k = 15:     d ≤ 3e8, 13 survivors, max d 2915
```

All 45 survivors fail the row-4 residual (banked). Two-row survivors continue
to appear at all scales but thin out; three-row survivors stop.

## 4. Literature status (verified 2026-07-09)

- erdosproblems.com/686 is OPEN; community results for N = 4: k = 2 (Tao),
  k = 3 (vilc, via Bennett's effective irrationality measures + Chan's gap
  principle), k = 4 (reduction to k = 2), k = 6 (Kovač sketch). k = 5 is
  explicitly open. The banked corpus already exceeds this.
- Fixed-k finiteness of `∏(m+i) = 4·∏(n+i)` IS known:
  Beukers–Shorey–Tijdeman 1999 (via Rakaczki 2003, Thm B) — but
  Siegel-ineffective; no bound exists to cite or formalize.
- No congruence obstruction exists for (N,k) = (4,5) (MalekZ): admissible
  congruential solutions exist for every modulus. Archimedean window input is
  unavoidable.
- Effective irrationality measures for 4^{1/k}: only k = 6 (2.45, Bennett),
  k = 12 (≤ 4.9), prime k ∈ [17,347] (Bennett 2001 Thm 7.1). Nothing for odd
  k ∈ {5,7,9,11,13,15}.
- Uniform-in-k finiteness (our large branch) is a special case of the open
  Erdős conjecture behind problem #388. Strongest citable effective input:
  Laishram–Shorey `P(∆(x,k)) > 1.95k` (elementary + explicit prime bounds).

## 5. Even k: the Kovač/Runge route (mathematics verified, Lean in progress)

For even k set `w = 2m+k+1`, `v = 2n+k+1` (odd); the equation becomes
`S_k(w) = 4·S_k(v)` with `S_k(W) = ∏_{l odd < k} (W² − l²)`.

- k ≡ 2 (mod 4): the polynomial part P of √S has 2-power denominators;
  `2^{e}·P` is odd-valued at odd arguments while the doubled side is even —
  a mod-2 gap of 2^{−v(k)} survives for all k ≡ 2 (mod 4) (verified k ≤ 60).
  Kills k = 6, 10, 14 outside an explicit finite region.
- k ≡ 0 (mod 4): P is integer-valued; the equation forces `P(w) = 2P(v)`
  AND `R(w) = 4R(v)` exactly (R = S − P², deg R ≤ k/2−2) for w beyond an
  explicit threshold. For k = 8: `R = −4096·W²`, so w = 2v — parity
  contradiction. For k = 12: the system's resultant is nonzero with no
  integer roots. Kills k = 8, 12.
- In all five cases the sub-threshold region satisfies d ≤ 220 (via the
  banked confinement lower bounds), already closed by the finite core.

[C] A uniform even-k statement (all even k ≥ 16) would need the 2-adic
coefficient pattern as a general lemma; per-k it is mechanical.

---

## 6. Large branch: what is actually known

[X] Fixed-prefix boundary (rows 1..15 ⟹ row 16 fails): FALSE at
(984, 3177026, 4480). Both known deep clusters die by the same mechanism —
a single prime `p | n+j` with no multiple of p in the row-j interval
`[d+1−j, d+k−j]` — but at different rows j (16 resp. 17).

[C] Open target: `LargeKEscapeHypothesis` (some row j ≤ k fails). The banked
mechanisms (`row_escape_of_large_prime_in_n_add`, transition package,
smoothness lemmas) remain usable per-row. Gross log-mass counting does not
suffice (supply ≈ 2k·log d exceeds demand ≈ k·log(0.72kd) always); the
rigidity is finer, Grimm-problem-adjacent.

[E] All rows-1..15-passing points with k ≤ 3000, n ≤ 10^7: exactly two
clusters (n = 48502, k ∈ [244,260]; n = 3177026, k ∈ [984,1050]); every point
fails some row j ≤ 17.

---

## 7. Refuted targets (do not revisit)

- [X] `RowSixteenBoundaryHypothesis` — see §0.
- [X] Bare residual obstruction without the window ((k,q,d,r) = (7,4,339,162)).
- [X] Affine-saturation-only route (k=7, d=302, u=135).
- [X] Polynomial prefixes a ≤ 14 and row prefixes j ≤ 15 (survivor clusters).
- [X] Pure congruence obstruction for (4,5) (admissible for every modulus).

## 8. Current proof obligations, ordered

1. [in flight] Even-k Runge theorems (k = 6,8,10,12,14) — restricts the open
   small-k core to odd k.
2. [open, highest mathematical value] `ConstantCaseBoundHypothesis` for odd
   k; sharpest attack: the k = 5 third-row (s,t)-elimination with the tight
   window pinning `s = σ·t + O(1)`, σ = (c−3)/(72−23c), plus the
   divisor-cascade identities of the form `e₁e₂ = 72⁵(T₂e₁ − T₁e₂)`.
3. [open] `LargeKEscapeHypothesis`: needs a genuinely new idea; the failing
   row is unbounded. Candidate frame: for every window point some `n + j`
   (j ≤ k) has a prime power with no multiple in its row interval.
4. Housekeeping: PR the conditional reduction toward formal-conjectures
   (`erdos_686.variants.four` is open there with `answer(sorry)`).

## 9. Terminal assessment: what blocks the full solve (2026-07-10)

The two open hypotheses are research problems, not formalization gaps:

**The six odd tails** (`OddThueTailHypothesis`, d ≥ 10^120).  Any
concrete bound is cheap (each decade of d costs ~2 CF terms in the
descent certificate; 10^1000 is minutes of work).  Unbounded closure
needs one of:
- an effective irrationality measure < k for `4^{1/k}` at odd
  k ∈ {5..15} — none exists; the hypergeometric method structurally
  fails at these k (verified);
- Baker–Feldman — effective on paper but with bounds ~10^(10^500),
  unreachable by certificate, and linear forms in logarithms have
  never been formalized in any proof assistant;
- structure in cf(4^{1/k}) — none known.
Beukers–Shorey–Tijdeman prove the tails are finite via Siegel —
fundamentally ineffective.  Watch the Calegari–Dimitrov–Tang holonomy
program (arXiv:2510.04156), which announces effective measures for
high-order roots: if explicit constants materialize for 4^{1/k}, the
tails become finishable on paper and then formalizable.

**Large-k double smoothness** (`LargeKSmoothHypothesis`).  A special
case of the open conjecture behind Erdős #388 (uniform-in-k
finiteness); needs Grimm-strength control of smooth numbers in sliding
windows.  Census evidence: no candidate in 145+ billion window points
(k ≤ 6500, n ≤ 3·10^7).

**Standing.**  Unconditional k ≤ 15 to d < 10^120 exceeds the
literature (community: k ≤ 4 plus a k = 6 sketch; k = 5 was open).
Natural next steps: upstream PR toward formal-conjectures
(`erdos_686.variants.four`), a note on the erdosproblems.com/686
forum, and monitoring the holonomy program.
